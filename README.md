# DTC-status-interpreter
The status of a DTC in a vehicle can help diagnose the cause of an issue and provide insight into the health of the vehicle.

DTC status is stored in one byte. Each bit of this status byte has its own meaning. Each bit can be high or low. If a particular bit is high then you can recognize the status of that fault from this masked bit.
This program helps us to interpret the DTC status byte.
